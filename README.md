Example of a little project which contains a CI/CD pipeline in order to test and build the code, dockerize it, publish in the github Registry (as package) and running
the script `update_app_version.sh` in order to trigger ArgoCD by updating the version in the deployment manifest.  
The following picture shows the CI/CD pipeline inspiration idea.
